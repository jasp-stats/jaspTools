\description{
Ensures that analyses can be run, tested and debugged locally by fetching all of the basic dependencies.
This includes fetching the data library and html files, installing jaspBase and jaspGraphs and adding the required-files.
If no parameters are supplied the function will interactively ask for the location of these dependencies.
